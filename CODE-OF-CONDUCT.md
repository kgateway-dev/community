# Kgateway Community Code of Conduct

All members of the kgateway community must abide by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).
Only by respecting one another can we build a strong and collaborative community.

While kgateway can be used to enable AI use cases, first and foremost it is a project by humans, for humans. Usage of AI during contributions must abide by the [Linux Foundation Generative AI policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/generative-ai).
In addition, please:

* Refrain from generating issues, comments, or PR descriptions with AI.
* Refrain from "vibe coding". AI should be used to assist and accelerate code that you (the human!) would write on your own.
* When using (non-trivial) AI assistance, please indicate this.

These policies ensure the code base is kept at a high level of quality. Additionally, it ensures maintainers do not waste time reviewing low-quality AI-generated code.
